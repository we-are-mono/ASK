"""Every ESP transform the offload admits, against a software peer.

The adapter admits each transform below for packet offload (cdx's algorithm
table, control_ipsec.c), and SEC runs each through a descriptor of its own: a
cipher and an authenticator with their own key and ICV sizes, or a combined
mode whose salt or nonce trails the key. The traffic suites carry CBC with
HMAC-SHA256 and GCM. Nothing else checks the rest against a real peer, so any
of them could install, report itself offloaded, and then emit frames no peer
accepts or refuse every frame a peer sends. Packet offload has no software
fallback, so a deployment that negotiates such a transform loses the tunnel
without any error.

Per transform, the DUT installs a tunnel-mode SA pair with packet offload on
the WAN port, and the WAN host installs the mirror in software. Linux's own ESP
is the reference. The DUT pings the peer's inner address, and the case proves:

  - both of the DUT's states are offloaded to the WAN port in packet mode;
  - every echo is answered;
  - the peer decrypted and authenticated exactly the echoes the DUT sent. The
    SA shows no replay or integrity failure and no XfrmIn* counter on the host
    moves;
  - the DUT's inbound SA accounts for exactly the replies. SEC encrypted every
    echo the CPU handed it, and the replies reached SEC through the classifier,
    not through a CPU-fed decrypt.

Each transform and each direction gets its own key, and no key is one repeated
byte. A repeated byte hides a key, salt or nonce read from the wrong offset,
and one key for both directions hides a direction using the other SA's key.

Out of scope: GCM at ICV 8 and 16 with a 128-bit key, whose forwarded traffic
test_flowtable_service_ipsec_replay.py carries, and GMAC, which the offload
refuses and which has a test of its own.

The file builds the inner addresses, the routes between them, the NAT
exemption and the policies once. Each case adds and removes only its SAs.

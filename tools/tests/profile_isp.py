"""The gateway as an ISP ships it, proved as one configuration rather than one
feature at a time.

Every other flowtable file isolates a single encapsulation and builds the
smallest topology that can carry it, which is what makes a failure legible.
None of them answers the question a release actually turns on: whether the
features hold *together*, on the box a subscriber has, while the events a real
line produces happen underneath them. That is this file.

The configuration is the production one. The uplink is PPPoE on a tagged
carrier VLAN, so every forwarded frame spends both encapsulation slots the WAN
direction has. The LAN is a VLAN-aware bridge over the one physical LAN port,
untagged on the subscriber VLAN and tagged for a guest network, which is the
shape OpenWrt renders. IPTV arrives on its own VLAN and is bridged at layer 2
into the same bridge, where the bridge's own IGMP snooping is the entire
control plane. Traffic is classified into CEETM queues by a conntrack mark, and
one port is forwarded from the WAN side into a LAN client. Five features, one
bridge, one physical port on each side.

One behaviour of the shipping configuration shapes every traffic case: a
subscriber's IPv4 UDP upload into the session stays in Linux. The LAN port can
deliver a full 1500-byte frame whatever MTU it is given and the session carries
1492, so the microcode would have to fragment it -- and its fragments of a frame
an Ethernet port received carry no payload. The download still crosses in
hardware, and so does all of TCP, which sets DF. So each case proves the UDP
download and the refusal of its upload, and proves the upload itself on a TCP
connection.

Two disciplines every case here keeps, because a profile test is exactly where
they are easiest to lose:

  - **the row names the encapsulation.** A frame that arrives is not evidence
    of anything: the Linux bridge floods, the CPU routes, and a software path
    produces the same delivery. Each case reads the adapter's own row back and
    requires it to name the session, the tags, the bridge and the class it was
    supposed to build, then sends a *second* burst and requires the classifier's
    own packet counters to account for all of it.
  - **the CPU did not do it.** The physical ports' software receive counters are
    read across the measured burst and have to stay flat while the hardware
    counters move. Those two together are the only pair that separates
    acceleration from a working stack.

The lifecycle half is the other reason the file exists. A line redials, a
subscriber changes channel, a LAN cable is pulled, an operator reloads the
offload policy -- and each of those has to retire exactly what depends on it and
readmit everything afterwards, with no reconfiguration in between, because a
subscriber does not reconfigure anything. Those cases run last, in that order,
against a profile the traffic cases have already driven.

Bench furniture this profile needs, none of it created here:

  - the orchestrator's standing `wan3900` device and its PPPoE access
    concentrator (flowtable_pppoe.py owns those; its server and dial
    helpers are imported rather than restated);
  - a multicast source on the WAN wire, which is the orchestrator itself,
    injecting untagged by default because the switch between it and the DUT does
    not trunk the IPTV VLAN. `ASK_PROFILE_IPTV_TAGGED=1` switches to a tagged
    injection once it does;
  - the QoS case needs the adapter booted with a nonzero
    `ask_flowtable.qos_mark_mask`; it skips, naming the parameter, otherwise.

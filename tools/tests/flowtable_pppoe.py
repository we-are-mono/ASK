"""PPPoE flowtable offload: the WAN sits behind a session, the LAN does not.

The asymmetry is the point, as it is for a tag. One direction arrives inside a
session and leaves bare, the other the reverse, so a single connection
exercises both the ingress strip and the egress insert and neither can be
mistaken for the other.

Two things make a session unlike a tag, and both are what these cases are for.
Netfilter describes an ingress session with *nothing* -- there is no pop action
and no dissector key, so the reverse direction's rule is byte-for-byte the rule
an unencapsulated flow produces, and only the devices say otherwise. And a ppp
device resolves no Ethernet destination at all: it is NOARP with no address, so
the four Ethernet mangles Netfilter writes are zeros and the real destination
is the concentrator the session named. Every case therefore asserts the session
the adapter recorded against `/proc/net/pppoe`, which is where the kernel's own
view of the negotiated session can be read back independently, and then sends a
second burst and requires the classifier's own packet counters to account for
all of it.

The session runs over a tag, because the bench's access concentrator lives on a
standing VLAN. That is not incidental: `ppp0` over `eth4.3900` over `eth4` puts
a session and a tag on one path, which is both encapsulation slots a direction
has, and it is the shape every case here runs in.

The bench side that pre-exists is used, never built: the orchestrator's
`wan3900` device and the LAN VM's route to the inner address are standing
state, so this file creates neither and removes neither.

An IPv4 UDP upload into the session stays in Linux, which is the shipping
behaviour rather than a bench limitation. It arrives on the LAN port, which can
deliver a full 1500-byte frame whatever MTU the port is given, and the session
carries 1492: the microcode would have to fragment it, and the fragments it
builds from a frame an Ethernet port received carry no payload. So the UDP
cases assert that refusal and prove the download -- the strip -- in hardware,
and every property of the upload -- the insert, the session MTU it describes,
the translation in front of it, the LAN tag it pops -- is proved on TCP, which
sets DF and is never the microcode's to fragment.

    (insert_remove_vlan_hm()). The carve opens with the session pool, so the
    pointer is the receive half of the first session record -- the very

    """The session going away retires the flow, and a redial readmits it.

    This is the dependency proof. The session is what the hardware inserts and
    strips, and nothing about it reaches the rule that could be revalidated
    later: the id is in an action the flow was built from once, and the
    concentrator's address is in no action at all. So hanging the session up
    has to retire the flow -- otherwise the hardware keeps inserting a session
    header the concentrator has already forgotten, and the frames vanish with
    every counter looking healthy.

    What notices is the route. pppd's peer route dies with the device, and the
    flow borrowed that destination, so the route watch retires its directions,
    normally before the device is even unregistered. Should the unregistration
    arrive while the entries are still being taken out, it retires them too
    rather than stopping admission: a ppp device is neither bound nor a port.
    That makes a session drop *selective*: the retirement costs
    the directions it should and nothing else, the bindings stay up, and
    admission is never disabled. A drop is therefore self-healing -- the table
    is not touched, nothing re-arms, and the next packet re-offers the flow
    against whatever session exists then, which is the assertion that matters
    and the one a stale entry would fail. The UDP upload is Linux's, so the
    direction in hardware on either side of the redial is the download, and
    the session it names is the one it strips.

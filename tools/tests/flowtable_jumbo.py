"""Jumbo frames through the offloaded path, and a standard port refusing them.

Each DPAA port's MAC accepts frames up to its own MTU -- never less than a
standard frame, and four bytes more when the port carries an upper device --
so a port's MTU bounds what its ingress can deliver. These cases raise every
hop they need to JUMBO for their own duration and put it back on the same
boot, whatever happens (_flowtable_jumbo.jumbo_path):

- routed NAT with every hop at JUMBO carries TCP at line rate in hardware and
  full-size jumbo datagrams byte for byte in both directions;
- a jumbo LAN host sending into a standard-MTU LAN port is dropped by that
  port's MAC rather than fragmented by the microcode with zeroed payloads
  (A316, the A202 class at the port);
- a jumbo LAN behind a standard WAN keeps TCP in hardware through MSS and
  path MTU, leaves oversized non-TCP to Linux -- which fragments IPv4 without
  DF correctly and answers DF and IPv6 with their errors -- and has the
  microcode fragment nothing;
- a tagged jumbo LAN carries jumbo datagrams in hardware under NAT;
- an installed flow follows its port's MTU down and back up at runtime.

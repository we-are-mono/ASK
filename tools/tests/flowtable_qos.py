"""Hardware QoS on offloaded flows, proved at rates only the hardware reaches.

Software forwarding on this rig tops out near 130 Mbit/s and the ports run at
10 Gbit/s, so every rate case here shapes or polices around 2 Gbit/s and offers
three times that. Delivery near the cap then says two things at once: the
hardware enforced the rate, and the flow was in hardware, because nothing else
could have carried it that fast. A low-rate result proves neither. Beside the
rate, two independent oracles:

  - **the adapter's row.** It names the class the hardware entry was given, and
    its packet counter moves only for frames the classifier matched.
  - **the leaf counters `ethtool -S` reports.** One set per leaf slot: what that
    class queue dequeued and what its congestion group rejected. An offloaded
    flow never reaches a leaf's software qdisc, so `tc -s class show` cannot see
    it; these can.

Most traffic runs from the orchestrator to the LAN VM, so the trees are built on
the LAN port. The orchestrator is the side that can offer several times the cap,
and the WAN port carries the agent every oracle is read through. The one case
about changing the WAN port's own egress runs the other way.

Enabling CEETM on a port moves its sub-portal's dequeues onto the LNI scheduler,
and removing a tree once left that switched, with the port reporting healthy
while it transmitted nothing. The fixture's last act is therefore to forward
traffic through both ports after every tree is gone: a case that leaves a port
unable to transmit fails there, not in whichever test happens to run next.

Needs `ask_flowtable.qos_mark_mask` nonzero -- the test image ships 0xf0 -- and
iperf3 on the LAN VM and on the orchestrator.

"""A multicast delete whose hardware barrier fails parks what it unlinked.

Withdrawing a group unlinks its classifier key and its listener chain from
tables the FMan microcode may be walking at that moment. Only a successful
host-command barrier proves the walk has left them; until one does, the memory
stays allocated in CDX's quarantine and /proc's `quarantine` counts it. These
cases fail that barrier on purpose while a control group stands, and require:

  - the parked entries to be exactly the withdrawn group's: its root plus one
    per listener for a delete, the displaced chain for a listener swap;
  - the control group and the survivors to keep replicating exactly, in
    hardware, while those entries are parked;
  - the next good barrier to release every one of them, including one the
    flowtable backend issues itself when no multicast delete is left to.

Any completed barrier on the PCD releases the backlog, so parked counts are
read straight after the failure. The windows between stay exact because the
cases that watch them run no unicast offload: no admission or unicast delete
can sync there. Nor any other multicast: a stream nobody on a snooping bridge
wants gets a discard entry of its own, whose add and age-out each end on a
barrier, so the bridged cases keep the segments' own multicast -- a bench
host's SSDP -- off the ports while they run.

The image is KASAN, and the splat window fails a case whose CPU touches memory
the quarantine should have kept. A walker in the microcode is not something
KASAN can see, which is why the accounting is exact rather than eventual.

Two knobs, because a group delete and a listener swap end on different
barriers. /proc/fm_ehash_hcsync_fail fails the one inside the classifier key's
own delete; /proc/cdx_mc_hcsync_fail fails the one dpa_control_mc.c issues
after unlinking a listener chain. Both read back how many failures remain
armed, and both are disarmed on the way out whatever happened.

The last two cases fail a delete before its unlink instead (ehash_fail_unlink),
which no barrier settles: the datapath stops, and CDX restarts it in the same
boot once the ports are idle (_flowtable_restart.py).

    The cases above fail the barrier after the key has left the table, so its
    entries can be parked. This one fails the delete before the unlink
    (ehash_fail_unlink): the root may still resolve and replicate through a
    listener chain nothing owns any more -- the state a unicast -EIO latches --
    so the ports stop rather than a root replicating to a revoked listener
    while /proc calls the group gone. With the ports idle CDX settles the root
    and its listeners and starts them again. The group standing beside it then
    replicates exactly in hardware, and the withdrawn one joins again and does
    too -- the settled key left nothing behind to collide with.

    The stopped ports take the management path with them, so the window is
    read over the UART; everything after the restart goes over the agent."""

"""Exact multicast traffic windows for the flowtable multicast cases.

Every window sends numbered streams and counts each sequence at every observer
beneath the IP layer (mroute_capture.py), so a copy that is missing, doubled or
still arriving after its listener left is a number rather than an impression.
Beside it, a counter on the ingress port's netdev hook says how much of each
stream the CPU carried: a replicated frame never reaches the host.

The rig traps that make a working offload read as dead are kept out of the
cases here rather than in each of them:

  - The LAN console is one channel. Captures and member hosts run on the LAN
    VM as background processes coordinated through files, so no window holds
    the console while traffic runs.
  - An IPv4 join through ip_mreq names its interface by address and silently
    lands on the default route's device. Hosts join through the index-based
    MCAST_* calls instead (multicast_member.py).
  - `ip -s mroute` lags the hardware by up to one fold interval. Every read of
    the kernel's counters here follows a read of /proc/cdx_flowtable, which is
    itself a fold.
  - Streams are injected on the orchestrator's physical port, so its own
    bridge's snooping cannot decide whether they reach the DUT at all.

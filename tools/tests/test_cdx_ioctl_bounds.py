"""C6/C7/C8/C9b: /dev/cdx_ctrl ioctl input bounds.

C6: dpa_cfg.c allocations driven by userspace `num_fmans`, `max_ports`,
    `max_dist`, `num_tables`. Post-fix they're capped at CDX_MAX_* and
    use kmalloc_array/kcalloc for overflow-safe scaling.
C7: off-by-one `fm_index > num_fmans` (should be `>=`).
C8: `queue_no` / `port_idx` / `dscp` bound checks.
C9b: CDX_CTRL_DPA_CONNADD was deleted — invoking it must return ENOTTY.

Only C6 is driven via CDX_CTRL_DPA_SET_PARAMS. Once the flowtable adapter
has claimed the backend at boot that ioctl is refused outright, so this
file pins the refusal and the host test pins the bounds behind it. C7/C8
are reachable only via specific control_*.c paths, not from the ioctl
surface. This file exercises the ioctl surface: C6 + C9b.

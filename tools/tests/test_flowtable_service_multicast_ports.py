"""Routed multicast under a ruleset that tells a group's streams apart by port.

A routed group is carried under its source and group alone -- the classifier
key stops at L3 -- and only once Linux has been seen forwarding a copy of it
to every oif. A copy on one UDP port says nothing of a stream on another, so a
rule that treats the ports differently keeps the group in software
(refused-ports) where Linux judges every packet: the port it drops receives
nothing, the one it forwards receives everything. A rule that reads ports but
cannot change the stream's fate -- fw4's ISAKMP accept ahead of the group's
own -- keeps nothing out of hardware. The rule gone, the group is carried with
every port again.

The same holds for what is not nftables. An iptables-legacy rule that splits
the ports keeps the group in software as refused-xtables: the kernel walks the
x_tables tables a copy crosses, and its own count of table changes has every
group asked again once the rule goes. A tc filter running in software where
the stream arrives or where a copy leaves keeps it there as refused-tc,
whatever the filter reads; nothing reports a filter's removal, so the group is
asked again at the next refresh. This image's own legacy ruleset, a legacy
rule that reads ports but cannot change the stream's fate, a chain that only
returns, and a hardware-only police on the uplink keep nothing out of
hardware.

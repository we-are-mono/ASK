"""A classifier delete CDX cannot prove stops the datapath, and CDX restarts it.

A delete that fails before its unlink leaves a key the FMan may still walk to.
CDX latches the failure, stops every classifier port and, once they are idle,
settles the key -- deleting it again or finding it in no bucket -- and starts
the ports again, all in the same boot. The unicast, multicast and IPsec cases
each fail one delete of their own kind (the test image's knobs) and hand the
stopped window to these helpers, which prove it and then the restart.

The test image's flowtable_restart_hold keeps the ports stopped, with every key
recorded, until it is cleared: that is the window a case inspects. The stopped
ports take the management path with them, so everything inside the window
goes over the DUT's UART; the agent is used again once the ports run.

CDX allows three restarts in ten minutes and then leaves the latch for a
reboot. The cases between them restart more often than that, and a rerun in
the same boot more again, so each runs inside restart_budget(), which raises
the limit for the case and puts it back after.

"""An IPsec tunnel between IPv6 endpoints is offloaded like an IPv4 one.

The SAs run between the DUT's and the WAN host's WAN-segment IPv6 addresses;
the inner traffic is IPv4 (flowtable_ipv6_sa.py carries IPv6 inside an IPv4
tunnel). Both halves are
taken by the hardware -- the outbound one addressed through IPv6's route and
neighbour discovery -- and the tunnel's flows are carried without Linux and
leave nothing in the clear.

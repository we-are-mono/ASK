    interval -- ten seconds by default -- while other queriers get the chance
    to answer, nor for IPv6 at all until a query of its own has gone out from a
    usable link-local address. Its first one leaves before the address exists,
    which counts it out until the next startup query, half a minute on.

    The bridged learner asks the bridge what it forwards, so while the bridge
    floods it refuses to carry the group (`refused-host`: the flood reaches
    the host too) rather than install the MDB's ports in its place. Restarting
    the querier once the address is usable, with a one-second response

    the later kill is precise instead of `pkill -f tcpdump`-broad.

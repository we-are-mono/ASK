"""The gateway as an enthusiast runs it: a plain routed uplink, a segmented
LAN, a VPN and a tunnel, proved as one configuration.

The other profile in this directory is the carrier shape -- a session on a
tagged uplink, IPTV, QoS. This one is the other half of the product's
deployment surface and shares almost nothing with it. The uplink is static
dual-stack on the WAN port with no session at all. The LAN is one physical port
carrying three VLANs, with a firewall policy between them rather than one flat
subnet. There is an IPsec tunnel to a peer on the WAN, a 6o4 tunnel giving the
main VLAN IPv6 through a broker, routed multicast fed by smcroute rather than
by a bridge's snooping, and an ingress policer on the uplink. Six features,
three of which the carrier profile never touches.

The point of running them together is what they share: one physical port on
each side, one conntrack table, one flowtable binding, one classifier. Inter-
VLAN routing between two VLANs on the same port is a hairpin, a bridge and a
tag at once, and it is the case most likely to break when any one of them
changes. The tunnel and the IPsec tunnel both ask the classifier to build an
outer header the CPU would otherwise have built. Multicast asks it to replicate
onto devices the unicast path never names.

The disciplines are this file's copy of the ISP profile's, and they are not
negotiable in either:

  - **the row names the encapsulation.** Delivery proves nothing on its own --
    the CPU forwards, the bridge floods -- so every case reads the adapter's own
    row back, requires it to name the bridge, tags, tunnel or SA it was supposed
    to build, then sends a second burst and requires the classifier's own packet
    counters to account for all of it.
  - **the CPU did not do it.** The physical ports' software receive counters
    stay flat across the measured burst while the hardware counters move.

The lifecycle half asks what happens when the parts move: the default route
changes and comes back, an IPsec SA is replaced under a live flow, a VLAN
membership is withdrawn from the LAN port, and finally the adapter itself is
unloaded and reloaded with the whole profile standing -- after which every
feature above is re-proved by a short burst rather than assumed.

Bench furniture this profile needs, none of it created here:

  - `smcroute` (`smcrouted` and `smcroutectl`) in the DUT image. Both are in the
    agent's argv allowlist already; the case skips, naming them, if the binaries
    are absent.
  - `iperf3` on the LAN VM and on the orchestrator, for the policer and the
    opt-in throughput case.
  - nothing on the WAN switch: unlike the ISP profile, nothing here is tagged
    on the uplink.

    every VLAN on a single trunk is a shape this product is not built for. The

    is what `apply` does. What must survive the round trip is everything the
    adapter did *not* own: the bridge, the VLANs, the firewall, the tunnels and
    the routes are the kernel's, and a reload that needed any of them rebuilt
    would mean an operator's `modprobe` costs them their configuration.

    Then every feature is re-proved by a short burst rather than assumed. The
    IPsec tunnel is the exception that has to be reinstalled: its hardware state
    belonged to the module, so its SAs are offered again -- which is itself worth
    proving, because it is what an operator would do.

    It is also the one thing the operator has to take down first. Every
    offloaded state and policy holds a reference on the module that provides
    its device operations, so the kernel can never call into unloaded text,
    and while the tunnel stands the unload is refused.

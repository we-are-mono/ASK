"""Bridge flowtable offload: the LAN sits behind br-ft, the WAN does not.

Three shapes, because a bridge changes the tag stack in three different ways.
"plain" is a bridge with VLAN filtering off, which adds nothing. "access" is a
vlan-aware bridge routed through br-ft.N over a port that is untagged for N --
the configuration OpenWrt actually ships, and the one where the wire carries
no tag at all even though a VLAN device is in the path. "tagged" is the same
bridge over a port that is tagged for N, where the tag survives to the wire.

Every case asserts the bridge and VID the adapter recorded, then sends a
second burst and requires the classifier's own packet counters to account for
all of it: the rule alone never proves the frame reached the wire.

The bridge FDB pins the egress port, so two further cases drive it directly --
a station that reappears on another bridge port, and an entry that ages out --
and require the flow to retire rather than keep forwarding to the old port.

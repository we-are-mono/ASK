"""G1 extension: caller drops CAP_NET_ADMIN between open() and ioctl().

The cdx dispatcher checks `capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)` per-ioctl, not per-fd-
open. So a process that opened /dev/cdx_ctrl with full caps but then
dropped CAP_NET_ADMIN (e.g. setcap-style binaries that shed caps before
running untrusted code on a privileged-opened fd) must still be rejected.

Mechanism (agent-side): _ioctl_work opens the device as root, then
capset()s CAP_NET_ADMIN out of effective+permitted+inheritable, then
issues the ioctl. The ioctl path's capable() check sees the stripped
set and returns -EPERM.

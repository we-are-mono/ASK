# Unlike every other flowtable test, these clients bind on the WAN host itself
# rather than on the LAN VM, so their source ports share a namespace with the sockets
# the rig fixture holds there: a UDP echo endpoint on (WAN_IP, DPORT) kept for
# the whole session, the TCP echo server on the same port, and the control
# server on DPORT + 1. SPORT and DPORT are adjacent, so deriving the second
# parameter's port as SPORT + 1 landed on the echo socket and bound
# EADDRINUSE. Take them from an offset nothing else uses; +32, +96 and +128
# are spoken for by the connections, selective-neighbour and routes tests.

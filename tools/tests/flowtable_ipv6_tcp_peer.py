"""LAN peer staged by test_flowtable_ipv6; commands use the tested connection.

The controller prepends LAN_IPV6, WAN_IPV6, SPORT and DPORT before staging this
file with lan_run_python. Driving the peer over the connection under test means
no second LAN console operation is needed while that connection is alive, which
matters because the UART is single-channel.

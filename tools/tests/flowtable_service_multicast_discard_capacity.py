"""A discard gives its group id up to a stream somebody wants.

A bridged stream nobody wants is dropped by a classifier entry of its own,
which holds a group id -- a family has 512, and both learners draw on them --
for as long as the stream keeps arriving. An upstream that never stops would
hold them for good, and every stream a listener joins afterwards would wait in
software, refused-failed. So an add that replicates and finds no id takes one
from the discard that counted the fewest frames over the last refresh, and is
made again at once.

The case fills a family: one stream per fill group, each with a static
membership on the LAN port, so the learner carries every one it has an id for
and refuses the rest. The memberships go and the streams do not: every entry
becomes a discard, and every id is still held. A host behind the LAN port then
joins one more group, whose stream has to be carried in hardware straight
away -- one discard gone for it, nothing counted as failing -- and stay carried
while the discards go on counting, with nothing given up again.

The fill streams come from a thread on this host, one prebuilt frame per group
each period over a raw socket on the DUT-facing port: often while the learner
learns them, and once a second after, which keeps every discard counting at
every refresh. Only the case's own groups and link-local control reach the
bridge meanwhile; the segment's own multicast would discard, and take ids, of
its own.

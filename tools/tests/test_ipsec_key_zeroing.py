"""H2 regression — an IPsec SA's cipher key is zeroed on free.

The H2 fix (613efa3) replaced kfree with kfree_sensitive on cipher_key /
auth_key / split_key in cdx_ipsec_sec_sa_context_free. A regression to plain
kfree leaves the key bytes sitting in the slab where the next consumer reads
them.

The SA arrives through xfrmdev_ops rather than through FCI, which is the only
thing that changed here: `ip xfrm state add ... offload packet` reaches
M_ipsec_sa_cache_create and the same SEC-context allocator, and deleting the
state reaches the same free. The subject is the allocator, not the door.

The oracle is a kernel-side debug probe at /proc/cdx/last_freed_key. The probe
(gated by CDX_DEBUG_KEY_ZEROING, on only in the meta-ask test image) snapshots
the cipher_key buffer immediately after kfree_sensitive returns. On a working
build the snapshot is mostly zero; under a plain-kfree regression the original
0xA5 bytes survive.

Note on assertion shape: the snapshot is NOT guaranteed all-zero even when H2
is correct — SLUB writes a freelist pointer into the freed slot before our
read. The cipher_key buffer is kzalloc(100), i.e. the kmalloc-128 cache, where
the hardened-SLUB free pointer sits at the slot's centre (offset ~64), outside
the sixteen-byte key at offset 0 — but the exact offset is layout-dependent,
so the test checks the cipher-key BYTE PATTERN instead: eight contiguous 0xA5
bytes must not appear and the total 0xA5 count must stay low. Under the fix
neither signal trips; under a plain-kfree regression at least one will, for
any freelist-pointer placement.

The probe's header carries a seq counter, bumped on every observed cipher_key
free. The test baselines seq right before its delete and polls for an advance,
so it cannot false-pass on a snapshot latched by an earlier free in the same
boot. If the sampled allocation happens to be a KFENCE object the probe cannot
read it post-free (captured=false, len=0); the test retries with a fresh SA.

False-pass caveats: active SLUB poisoning (CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG_ON=y or a
slub_debug=P boot arg — plain CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y is inert) fills freed slabs
with 0x6b, and CONFIG_INIT_ON_FREE_DEFAULT_ON (or init_on_free=1) zeroes them;
either hides a kfree regression from this test. The meta-ask kernel activates
neither. If that changes, this test must be revisited.

"""The offload service is default-on: a normal boot installs the catch-all
policy across the CDX physical ports with no configuration, the way CMM "just
worked". This is the parity guarantee of the C ask-flowtable daemon.

Order-independent: it (re)starts the boot service itself, so it does not depend
on running before the controlled tests that stop the daemon for their own
policies. It restarts the service at teardown so the image is left in its
normal default-on state.

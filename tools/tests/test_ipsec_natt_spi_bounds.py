"""H5 regression — the NAT-T per-flow SPI array bound is `>=`, not `>`.

The H5 fix (613efa3) flipped the bounds check in
cdx_ipsec_process_udp_classification_table_entry (cdx/cdx_dpa_ipsec.c) from
`> MAX_SPI_PER_FLOW` to `>= MAX_SPI_PER_FLOW`, so an index equal to
MAX_SPI_PER_FLOW — one past the end of spi_param[16] — is refused instead of
written out of bounds.

Reaching that check used to be the hard part, and under xfrmdev_ops it stops
being hard at all. The bound lives inside `if (natt_sa && natt_sa->ct)`,
entered only when a *prior* same-flow NAT-T SA still holds a populated ct. An
FCI-installed SA could not: production resolved an SA's kernel state by handle
and a synthetic SA had none, so its push failed and its ct was torn down
again — which is why this test used to need the CDX_DEBUG_IPSEC_TEST_XFRM
by-SPI fallback to fabricate one. An offloaded SA is built *from* a real
xfrm_state, and cdx_ipsec_sa_add() binds it before the entry is installed. The
ct survives because the SA is genuine, so the array accumulates on its own and
the test hook is not part of this any more.

Fill semantics, one SPI per SA:
  - the first SA of a flow finds no twin, so the entry is built and takes
    slot 0;
  - each later same-flow SA finds the populated ct, and the lowest free slot;
  - when the array is full the index comes back as MAX and the check refuses
    it, with no write past the end.
So MAX distinct same-flow SPIs install, and the next one is refused.

Same flow means the same family, addresses and UDP port pair — every SA here
shares all of those and differs only in SPI, which is exactly
M_ipsec_get_matched_natt_tunnel's predicate.

Run under KASAN (KASAN=1 kas build): a regressed `>` would let the index
through and write spi_param[MAX] out of bounds, which the refusal oracle alone
would miss if the write happened to succeed. splat_window is that oracle.

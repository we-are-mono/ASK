"""Lifetimes and sequence numbers of offloaded SAs, as xfrm keeps them.

Packet offload bypasses xfrm_output_one() and xfrm_input(), where the stack
counts an SA's traffic and judges its limits. The adapter carries SEC's per-SA
counters into the state's current lifetime once a second and lets
xfrm_state_check_expire() decide, so byte and packet limits fire through
xfrm's own soft and hard expiry, up to one accounting pass late.

An outbound SA's sequence number crosses the same boundary both ways: the
number the state was installed with seeds SEC, and SEC's position is published
back into the state. A non-ESN SA near the end of its 32-bit space is asked to
rekey with a soft expiry, since SEC will not wrap it.

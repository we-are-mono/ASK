"""Bulk TCP through a packet-offloaded tunnel, on the software path.

TCP hands the stack GSO packets. A local socket builds them from its send
queue, because a bundle whose SA is offloaded on the route's own port keeps
the socket's segmentation offload (xfrm_dst_offload_ok()); the LAN port's GRO
merges forwarded segments into them. With no flowtable every one reaches
xfrm_output() for the offloaded SA. SEC encrypts one packet per ESP and needs
the inner checksums finished, so each GSO packet has to be segmented in
software before SEC sees it; finishing a GSO packet's checksum in place is
refused with a warning and the packet dropped.

Two transfers of a known size over one SA pair, to a TCP sink on the WAN
host: one from the LAN VM, forwarded by the DUT, and one from the DUT itself,
from an address on its loopback. Each must arrive whole and in order, and the
sink's count must come back through the tunnel; XfrmOutError must not move;
and SEC must have been handed at least one frame per full-size segment. The
splat window fails the test on the warning. A kprobe on the software
segmentation must count more during each transfer than a quiet window's rate
accounts for over the same time, so the test cannot pass on a path that never
built a GSO packet.

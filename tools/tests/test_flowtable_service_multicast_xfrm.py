"""Routed multicast under an XFRM output policy.

Linux applies IPsec to a forwarded IPv4 multicast copy in one place: the
output route ipmr looks up for each oif, whose XFRM lookup can block the copy
or require a transform the copy then either takes or, with no state, is
dropped for. A hardware copy never takes that route. So an IPv4 group with any
oif a policy governs stays in software (refused-xfrm), and a policy added under
a group already carried takes it out of hardware -- with no nftables or MFC
change to wake anything else. ip6mr's output route takes no XFRM lookup, so
there the same policy governs nothing and the group stays carried: parity
either way.

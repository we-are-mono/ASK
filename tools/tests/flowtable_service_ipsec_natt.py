"""UDP-encapsulated ESP (NAT-T) through the offload.

xfrm hands the adapter an SA's encapsulation ports in network byte order, and
the SA cache keeps them in host order: cdx_ipsec_set_natt() converts them.
The outbound PDB writes them into the UDP header SEC puts in front of ESP, and
the inbound SA's classifier entry is keyed on them. A symmetric pair such as
4500/4500 cannot tell a byte swap, or the two ports swapped with each other,
from the right answer. So the DUT's end here is 4500 and the peer's 31000, as
behind a NAT, and the wire is checked per direction.

Transport mode is refused: SEC builds the UDP header, and the decapsulation
offset past it, only on its tunnel arms, so a transport SA would leave as bare
ESP. Packet offload has no software fallback (xfrm_dev_state_add() returns
the driver's error for it), so the add fails with the adapter's reason. And an
in-place update may not change an offloaded SA's ports, which the hardware SA
carries, or its output mark, which chose the route that addressed it; no
update reaches the driver.

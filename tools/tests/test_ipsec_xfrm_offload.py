"""The xfrmdev_ops control plane: a packet-offload SA reaches the hardware.

  test_esp_hw_offload_advertised
      The CDX physical ports carry NETIF_F_HW_ESP. This is not cosmetic:
      strongSwan resolves the position of the `esp-hw-offload` feature once
      at startup and then tests it per interface before it will ask the
      kernel for offload at all. A port that does not advertise it is never
      offered an SA, and the tunnel runs in software with nothing saying so.

  test_packet_offload_sa_install
      `ip xfrm state add ... offload packet dev <wan> dir out` is accepted,
      and `ip -d xfrm state` reports the offload back. Without xfrmdev_ops
      on the device, xfrm_dev_state_add() refuses a packet-offload request
      with -EINVAL before any driver runs, so this is the first end-to-end
      assertion that the control plane exists.

The update-software case also checks retirement of the temporary hardware
SA created by UPDSA. These control-plane tests send no traffic.

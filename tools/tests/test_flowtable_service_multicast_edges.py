"""The multicast cases between the common ones.

  - a routed source moving to another input port, which changes the key;
  - two sources of one group, which are two keys;
  - the two learners handing one key between them as the topology changes;
  - the adapter reloaded under standing groups;
  - `ip -s mroute` across the group leaving and re-entering hardware;
  - a forward chain dropping a routed group toward one of its oifs.

Each case reads the same three things as the rest of the suite: every
sequence at every observer, the classifier's own count on the adapter's row,
and whether the CPU carried the stream at all.

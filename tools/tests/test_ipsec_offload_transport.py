"""A packet-offloaded transport-mode SA, which its peer decrypts.

Transport mode keeps the packet's own IP header, so SEC has to be told how
long that header is and where its next-header byte sits: it moves that byte
into the ESP trailer, writes ESP in its place and encrypts what follows. The
DPAA driver hands SEC those values per frame in DPOVRD, which overrides the
SA's PDB. A tunnel's value there -- the inner protocol, with header length and
offset zero -- makes SEC encrypt the IP header itself and name IPIP in the
trailer, and nothing the peer receives decodes.

The DUT sends UDP from its WAN address to an address on the WAN host's
loopback through an offloaded transport SA; the WAN host's half is ordinary
software. Half the datagrams carry IPv4 options, whose longer header the SA's
PDB alone would get wrong. Every datagram must arrive once and intact, the
DUT's port must have handed SEC exactly that many frames, the peer's SA must
have decrypted as many, and the peer must have refused nothing.

A second case selects every protocol between the two hosts, which is what
strongSwan installs for a host-to-host SA and so what a transport SA usually
runs under, and sends datagrams as large as the SA carries: each leaves SEC as
a frame exactly the port's MTU. A selector that wide also covers the SA's own
ESP, and the adapter once asked for the route to the peer through xfrm, which
answered with the SA's own bundle and its inner MTU. The SA's entry then
bounded every frame leaving SEC by that, and excepted or fragmented the
full-size ones (A231). Every frame must cross whole: the peer sees each as one
ESP frame of the full size, the microcode fragments nothing, and every
datagram arrives, with DF and without.

    The microcode fragments a non-DF IPv4 packet that exceeds its entry's MTU,
    and for a frame an Ethernet port received every payload byte of every
    fragment it builds is zero. So a UDP direction whose path is smaller than
    the largest frame its ingress port can deliver stays in Linux. Here the
    host route to the WAN endpoint is lowered to 1200 for the test: the
    LAN-to-WAN direction is refused, while the reverse -- arriving on the WAN
    port and leaving by the LAN port at its full MTU -- is still installed.

    The LAN sends 1250-byte payloads at its interface MTU with DF clear --
    whatever path MTU it learned from earlier tests -- and the WAN endpoint
    receives without answering. Every packet must leave the WAN port as exactly
    two fragments within 1200 bytes that carry the datagram's own bytes, the
    endpoint must reassemble each exactly once, and the microcode's fragmenter

    the non-DF UDP case keeps in Linux -- and both directions of one connection
    are installed with it and carry an upload in hardware.

    Then the WAN host sends one segment on the installed tuple, one byte over

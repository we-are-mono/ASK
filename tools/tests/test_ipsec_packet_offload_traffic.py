"""A packet-offload tunnel carries traffic, and SEC is what carries it.

The tunnel runs between the DUT and the LAN VM, which is the right shape for
this: both ends are ordinary hosts on one segment and nothing in the path
belongs to the machine running the test. An earlier revision put the far end
on the orchestrator itself, where the decrypted datagrams reached the IP layer
and were then dropped by that host's own input path -- a bench artefact that
said nothing about the offload.

Only the DUT is offloaded. The LAN VM is plain software IPsec and has no idea
its peer is not, so its decryption is an independent check on what SEC emitted.

Three oracles, each answering a different question:

  - `tx toenc` on the DUT's LAN port advances by the packet count, so SEC
    produced the frames rather than the software crypto path;
  - the LAN VM's SA decrypts the same count, so those frames were well-formed
    ESP for this SPI and not merely emitted; and
  - the payloads arrive intact, so the inner packets survived the round trip.

No flowtable entry is involved: every packet goes through the stack and is
handed to SEC on the way out, which is what makes this the slow path.

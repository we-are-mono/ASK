"""An offloaded tunnel SA answers an oversized IPv4 datagram with DF as Linux does.

Linux bounds a direction into an SA by the bundle's MTU, the smaller of the
SA's MTU on the path to the peer and the inner route's, and answers an
oversized IPv4 datagram with DF by Fragmentation Needed carrying that bound.
The SA's MTU is what xfrm computes for the transform over the path: for
AES-CBC with HMAC-SHA256-128 over IPv4 on a 1500-byte port,
((1500 - 20 - 8 - 16 - 16) & ~15) - 2 = 1438.

The classifier entry is given that bound with SEC's expansion on top, and the
microcode adds the expansion to a packet bound for SEC before the size check
that hands an oversized IPv4 packet with DF to Linux. Three things kept the
two bounds apart. The expansion was the headers alone, because the SA was
programmed while xfrm still held the state as not yet valid, so a DF datagram
between the SA's MTU and the port's less the headers (1439-1456 bytes for that
transform) went to SEC and left it larger than the port (A227). The entry
took the port's MTU in place of the flow's, so an inner route with an MTU of
its own was not the bound at all: DF datagrams between it and the SA's MTU
crossed in hardware where Linux answers them (A230). And the SA's MTU was
taken from the port once, when the SA was installed, so a narrower hop on the
way to the peer -- a route to it with an MTU of its own, or a PMTU learned for
it -- never reached the hardware, which kept encrypting DF datagrams Linux
answers into frames the path cannot carry (A231).

Each case runs with the bound set a different way: by the SA's MTU on the
port, with the inner route carrying no MTU; by the fixture's own inner route
MTU, below the SA's; and by a 1492-byte hop to the peer, either a route with
that MTU or a PMTU learned from the peer's Fragmentation Needed. The hop
narrows after the flow is in hardware, which is the order it happens in
practice: the SA's MTU on the port crosses in hardware first, then the
narrowing retires the directions the SA encrypts and the flow's next packets
readmit them under the path's bound. Every DF size over the bound draws
Linux's answer; one at exactly the bound crosses the tunnel in hardware as
one frame; and, below the SA's MTU, one without DF over the inner route's
crosses too, whole, as Linux itself sends it.

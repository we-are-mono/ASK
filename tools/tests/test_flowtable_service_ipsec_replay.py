"""Sequence numbers and anti-replay on offloaded SAs, across ciphers and feeders.

An SA's SEC queue has two feeders in each direction. Outbound, the classifier
enqueues offloaded flows and the CPU everything else. Inbound, the classifier
steers whole ESP frames to SEC by SPI, while an outer IP fragment cannot match
that entry: the CPU reassembles it, and xfrm_input() hands it to the same queue
(the software SEC submit, `tx todec`). Whichever feeder a frame takes, one
shared descriptor holds the SA's sequence state, so a sequence number seen
through one feeder must be refused through the other.

AEAD SAs take a different sharing policy from CBC+HMAC (SERIAL without
SAVECTX, cdx_ipsec_sh_desc_hdr_flags()), and each ICV length is its own
descriptor, so the traffic and shared-sequence proofs are repeated for them.

The replayed ESP is built on this host with the fixture's keys. The suite's
scapy has no cryptography backend, so the cipher runs in this host's kernel
through AF_ALG: the same implementation the peer's own SAs use.

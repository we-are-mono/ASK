"""Failslab sweep over an offloaded SA install — M7-class regression net.

Drives cdx_ipsec_sec_sa_context_alloc (cdx/cdx_dpa_ipsec.c) into NULL with
fork-isolated fail-nth. The key and descriptor buffers are allocated there,
from M_ipsec_sa_cache_create, immediately after sa_alloc(); on NULL the
allocator frees what it has taken so far and the caller frees the SA struct.

The door is xfrmdev_ops rather than FCI, which is what re-pointing this test
meant: `XFRM_MSG_NEWSA` reaches xdo_dev_state_add(), then cdx_ipsec_sa_add(),
then the same allocator. What FCI spelled as five commands in sequence is one
message here, so one sweep covers the whole install instead of one step of it.

The window is the head of that install, and it is worth being exact about
what that means now rather than after a green run proves nothing. Faulting
the first N allocations covers xfrm's own state construction *and* the SA
cache, in that order, and the prefix is not short: `__xfrm_init_state` builds
the ESP transform through `crypto_alloc_aead("authenc(hmac(sha256),cbc(aes))")`
before `xfrm_dev_state_add()` ever reaches this driver. FCI had almost no
prefix; this one has tens of allocations. Nothing observable from the netlink
reply separates a fault in that prefix from one in the SA cache, so the
default sweep is long enough to cover both rather than proving it reached the
second. What keeps the result meaningful is the kmemleak filter: it names cdx
symbols only, so a leak it reports is cdx's regardless of which half of the
window faulted.

The tail — the descriptor build and the classifier entry — is
test_ipsec_dma_balance.py's window.

Oracles:
  - splat_window — no oops/lockdep/UBSAN/KASAN report during the sweep.
  - kmemleak, filtered to IPSEC_LEAK_FILTER — nothing leaked across the
    faulted iterations' unwind paths.

Every attempt uses a fresh SPI, so a faulted install cannot collide with the
next attempt's key in the SA hash table.

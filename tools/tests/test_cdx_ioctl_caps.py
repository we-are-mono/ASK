"""G1 + G2: /dev/cdx_ctrl capability gate + single-open race fix.

G1 (ISSUES.md): cdx_ctrl_ioctl lacked a CAP_NET_ADMIN check; any open
with mode 0660 could reconfigure the DPAA datapath. Fix added
`if (!capable(CAP_NET_ADMIN)) return -EPERM` at dispatch.

G2: cdx_dev.c open path used `atomic_dec_and_test` then `atomic_inc` on
failure — racy check-then-act. Fix switched to `atomic_cmpxchg(1→0)`.
The behaviour we care about: exactly one opener gets the fd, the rest
get EBUSY.

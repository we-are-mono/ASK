"""Shared IPsec helpers: SAs installed the way the offload control plane
installs them.

The control plane is `xfrmdev_ops`. strongSwan asks for `hw_offload = packet`
per child SA, the kernel resolves the state and hands it to
`xdo_dev_state_add()`, and the adapter programs CDX from there. So an SA here
is an XFRM `NEWSA`, not the five-command FCI sequence the retired daemon used:
FCI's `CMD_IPSEC_SA_*` reached the same allocator, the same descriptor builder
and the same classification-entry path, but through a door that goes away with
CMM.

Two ways in, and the difference is only how much the caller needs to steer.

`ip xfrm state add` through the agent's command channel is the readable one,
and what a real deployment does. Use it wherever the test is about the SA's
effect.

The raw `NEWSA` builders below are the other, and they exist for one reason:
fault injection needs an armed window covering exactly one send, so the
message has to be built here rather than by `ip`, whose own startup would
spend the fail-nth counter long before the SA allocator ran. The wire layout
is `include/uapi/linux/xfrm.h`, checked with `offsetof` against the kernel
this image is built from:

  xfrm_selector     56 B
  xfrm_id           24 B    (daddr 16, spi 4, proto 1, pad)
  xfrm_usersa_info 224 B    (sel 0, id 56, saddr 80, lft 96, curlft 160,
                             stats 192, seq 204, reqid 208, family 212,
                             mode 214, replay_window 215, flags 216)
  xfrm_algo         68 B + key      (name 64, key_len 4)
  xfrm_algo_auth    72 B + key      (name 64, key_len 4, trunc_len 4)
  xfrm_user_offload  8 B            (ifindex 4, flags 1, pad)
  xfrm_encap_tmpl   24 B            (type 2, sport 2, dport 2, pad, oa 16)

`sa_install_probe()` sends one unencumbered NEWSA and reads the state back
before any sweep begins, so a layout mistake fails loudly at the start rather
than turning a whole sweep into a no-op.

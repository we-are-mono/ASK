"""H3 regression — the classifier-entry build unwinds cleanly under failslab.

The H3 fix (613efa3) hardened the tail of an SA install, the part that turns a
described SA into a hardware one:

  - the info / sa->ct kzalloc unwind in
    cdx_ipsec_add_classification_table_entry (cdx/cdx_dpa_ipsec.c), whose
    err_ret frees both and rolls back SA_SH_DESC_BUILT, and
  - cdx_ipsec_create_shareddescriptor with its err_unmap_crypto /
    err_unmap_auth DMA-map unwind.

Under xfrmdev_ops that tail is reached by the same message as everything else:
`XFRM_MSG_NEWSA` → xdo_dev_state_add() → cdx_ipsec_sa_add() →
ipsec_install_fp_entry(). What used to need CMD_IPSEC_SA_SET_STATE as a
separate step, and needed the SA's daddr to match a DUT-local address before
the push would even start, now needs only that the SA installs — the local
endpoint being an address on the port is part of installing one.

So this file and test_ipsec_failslab.py sweep the same call, and the
difference between them is *where in it* the fault lands. The install's
faultable-allocation count is measured first, and this sweep takes the last
stretch of it: the SA cache and the key buffers are allocated early, the
descriptor maps and the table entry late. Sweeping the head instead would
fault the allocator over and over and never reach the maps this test is a
tripwire for.

Oracles: kmemleak filtered to the IPsec path for the info / sa->ct unwind,
and splat_window for a use-after-unmap or an overflow on an unwound buffer.
Only the second covers the DMA maps -- an unbalanced dma_map_single is not an
allocation kmemleak tracks, and the helpers that take one are a macro and a
static inline, so no filter could name them either. So run this under KASAN
(KASAN=1 kas build); without it half the point is gone.

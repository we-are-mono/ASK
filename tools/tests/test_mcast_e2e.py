"""End-to-end multicast offload: a real consumer joins, a real source sends.

Everything else that touches multicast in this suite programs a group by hand
over FCI and then checks the hardware replicated it. That proves the encoder.
It cannot prove the thing this increment is actually about, which is that
nobody has to program anything: the LAN VM sends an IGMP or MLD report, the
bridge's own snooping learns the group, and the offload follows from that.

Topology. vision (the orchestrator, this host) is the source, on the DUT's WAN
port. loki (the LAN VM) is the consumer, behind the DUT and reachable only over
the libvirt UART. The DUT bridges the two.

**The assertion that matters is not that loki receives the stream.** The Linux
bridge floods multicast perfectly well in software, so arrival proves
forwarding and says nothing about offload. Each case therefore carries three
oracles, and the third is the one that discriminates:

  1. `bridge mdb show` reports `offload` against the port group. Read this as
     "the adapter took responsibility for the group", not "the hardware is
     carrying it": the switchdev handler runs under RTNL and cannot take the
     transaction an install needs, so it decides and a work item installs.
     See docs/flowtable-multicast.md, "The handler cannot install".
  2. The group is present in the hardware table, read from /proc. THIS is
     "actually installed", and it is where a disagreement with (1) surfaces.
  3. **The DUT's CPU does not see the stream.** A hardware-replicated frame is
     matched and transmitted by the FMAN and never reaches the host, so a
     capture on the DUT's bridge device counts ~0 while loki counts thousands.
     Software flooding cannot produce that, and neither can a group that is
     merely present in a table but not matching.

The three deliberately mean different things — accepted, installed, and
matching — so a case that passes all three has been checked at three
independent points rather than three times at one.

IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 are both covered and the split is not incidental. The
classifier key is an exact (S,G), so a v3 INCLUDE report — which carries a
source — is installable from the membership alone, while a v2 report or a v3
EXCLUDE{} gives a (*,G) the membership cannot key, and the group only appears
once traffic has taught the adapter its source and ingress port. Those are two
different halves of the learner, and a suite that used whatever `ip maddr`
happened to emit would exercise one of them.

    The querier is not optional. Without one nothing on the segment elicits
    membership reports, the MDB stays empty, and the bridge floods every group
    to every port — which looks exactly like a working test and proves nothing.

    **The enslavement cannot go over the agent, and an earlier revision of this
    fixture tried.** The agent is reached on the WAN port's own address, and the
    moment that port becomes a bridge port its address stops receiving — a
    bridge port's frames go to the bridge, not to the port. Every later step,
    including this fixture's own teardown, was then issued down a path that no
    longer existed: the run hung at the first case and left the port enslaved,
    recoverable only by a login on the serial console.

    So the address follows the port into the bridge, as one sequence on the
    console, and two details keep the orchestrator from noticing. The bridge is
    created carrying the WAN port's own MAC rather than the lowest port's, so
    the peer's neighbour entry stays correct and no repin is needed. And the

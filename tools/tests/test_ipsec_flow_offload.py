"""A tunnelled flow is steered to SEC by the classifier, not by the stack.

Step 4 proved SEC can encrypt: every packet crossed the CPU, was handed to the
engine, and came back. This is the fast path, where the classifier entry itself
names the SA and the frames never reach the driver's transmit function at all.

The oracle that separates the two is `tx toenc`, which counts frames the
*software* path handed to SEC. On the slow path it advances once per packet. On
the fast path it advances exactly **once** -- for the packet that travelled
before the hardware entry existed -- and then stops while the rest of the
transfer goes through. Throughput cannot tell the two apart; this can.

The tunnel runs between the DUT and the LAN VM, and the traffic is *forwarded*
by the DUT rather than generated on it, which is the shape a gateway actually
has. The test host is the far end of the forwarded flow, not of the tunnel.

Also asserted here, because it is what this increment exists to prevent: a flow
whose policy resolves to no usable SA must be refused, never installed in the
clear. Admission used to ask the *destination* whether it was transformed
(`dst_xfrm`), which is never true for a forwarded flow -- those are routed
plainly and transformed later at POSTROUTING -- so a flow under a `level
required` policy was offloaded and forwarded unencrypted.

"""The two device-wide meters, set, read back and flooded through devlink.

Neither belongs to a netdev a `tc` filter could sit on, so cdx registers both
on the FMAN's own devlink instance as trap policers. Policer 1 meters what the
classifier punts to the CPU: every frame that misses every entry. Policer 2
meters what the classifier hands to the SEC engine, which a flow bound for an
offloaded SA meets instead of the profile its own class names. Each is a rate
and a burst in packets, and a drop count.

The floods offer about a thousand packets a second above a thousand-packet
rate. A profile programmed with equal committed and peak rates passes the
burst it starts with and then its rate, and colours everything else red, which
it drops and counts. So what gets through is the rate over the flood's
duration plus the burst, and the drop counter reports the rest. The tolerance
is the profile's rate resolution and whatever background traffic shares the
meter for those few seconds -- not an allowance for the arithmetic.

Every value a case sets is put back as devlink reported it before the case, by
the fixture, whatever the case did. devlink reports what each meter was created
with until something sets it, so what the fixture puts back is what the
hardware ran at boot, not a placeholder that would switch a meter off.

"""IPv6 inside an IPsec tunnel with an IPv4 outer header, in hardware.

The adapter accepts IPv4 tunnel endpoints only, so an IPv6 flow reaches an SA
as IPv6-in-IPv4: a dual-stack LAN's IPv6 carried over an IPv4 site-to-site
tunnel. What such a direction does with a packet too big for the SA's bundle
is the question here. Software checks a packet against the bundle's MTU, the
outer device's less the ESP expansion, and answers an oversized one with
Packet Too Big (xfrm6_tunnel_check_size). The entry is programmed with the
port's MTU and the expansion on top, so the hardware takes the packet, and
what it does next is what these cases pin: it encrypts the inner packet whole
and fragments the outer IPv4 packet, whose DF it leaves clear because the
inner family has none to copy. The inner packet is never fragmented, which is
what bounding an IPv6 direction exists to prevent (a router must not fragment
IPv6), and it arrives exactly once. Outer fragmentation is what Linux itself
does for an IPv4 inner packet without DF.

The same tunnel is also what carries IPv6 across a WAN that has no IPv6 at
all, and that case gets its own test. There the remote IPv6 prefix is routed
to the WAN port with no gateway and nothing else: no IPv6 default route and no
IPv6 neighbour on the link. A packet-offloaded bundle has to take its child
route from the flow, since the SA's IPv4 endpoints mean nothing to IPv6
routing, and the software path has to hand the plaintext to SEC without
resolving a neighbour of the inner destination, which nothing on the link
would answer.

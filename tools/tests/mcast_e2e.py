"""End-to-end multicast offload: a real consumer joins, a real source sends.

Programming a group by hand and checking the hardware replicated it proves the
encoder. It cannot prove the thing this file is actually about, which is that
nobody has to program anything: the LAN VM sends an IGMP or MLD report, the
bridge's own snooping learns the group, and the offload follows from that.

Topology. vision (the orchestrator, this host) is the source, on the DUT's WAN
port. The LAN VM is the consumer, behind the DUT and reachable only over
the libvirt UART. The DUT bridges the two.

**The assertion that matters is not that the LAN VM receives the stream.** The Linux
bridge floods multicast perfectly well in software, so arrival proves
forwarding and says nothing about offload. Each case therefore carries three
oracles, and the third is the one that discriminates:

  1. `bridge mdb show` reports `offload` against the port group. Read this as
     "the adapter took responsibility for the group", not "the hardware is
     carrying it": the switchdev handler runs under RTNL and cannot take the
     transaction an install needs, so it decides and a work item installs.
     See docs/flowtable/multicast.md, "The handler cannot install".
  2. The group is present in the hardware table, read from /proc. THIS is
     "actually installed", and it is where a disagreement with (1) surfaces.
  3. **The DUT's CPU does not see the stream.** A hardware-replicated frame is
     matched and transmitted by the FMAN and never reaches the host, so a
     counter on the ingress port's netdev hook, keyed on the stream's own UDP
     port, counts ~0 while the LAN VM counts thousands.
     Software flooding cannot produce that, and neither can a group that is
     merely present in a table but not matching.

The three deliberately mean different things — accepted, installed, and
matching — so a case that passes all three has been checked at three
independent points rather than three times at one.

IGMPv2 and IGMPv3 are both covered and the split is not incidental. The
classifier key is an exact (S,G), so a v3 INCLUDE report — which carries a
source — is installable from the membership alone, while a v2 report or a v3
EXCLUDE{} gives a (*,G) the membership cannot key, and the group only appears
once traffic has taught the adapter its source and ingress port. Those are two
different halves of the learner, and a suite that used whatever `ip maddr`
happened to emit would exercise one of them.

"""A multicast host on the LAN VM, staged unchanged and run in the background.

It holds one membership through the socket calls a real receiver makes, so the
kernel emits exactly the report its version and filter mode produce, and it
changes that membership only when the controller asks. Receiving is not its
job: mroute_capture.py counts the replicas beneath the IP layer, which is what
also shows whether they still reach the port after the host has gone.

The controller writes a command file atomically; this process acknowledges
each command by its serial in the state file. stdlib only.

"""Interface counters for offloaded traffic, read where an operator reads them.

An offloaded frame never reaches the CPU, so nothing the driver counts sees it.
What `ip -s link` and /proc/net/dev show for a port or a VLAN device instead
comes from the firmware's own per-interface records, folded into the device's
counters by dev_get_stats() in the device's own units. These cases send a burst
of known size through a tagged LAN and require that:

- the firmware records count every frame of the burst, with the framing the
  hardware was measured to count -- the frame as it stands once the record's
  own tag has been handled;
- the devices' native counters move by the burst restated into their units,
  while the driver's own software counters (ethtool -S) do not, which is what
  says the frames went through hardware;
- the two native surfaces agree with each other;
- and a frame the flowtable forwards in software is counted by the driver too,
  which it was not before the stack's return value stopped being read as a
  drop report;
- and a device's record stays out of the pool while a hardware entry that may
  still write it is unproven, so the next device is handed a sound one.
